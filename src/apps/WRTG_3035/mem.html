          Rise of the Tomb Raider retains the same controls as the last Tomb Raider reboot by Square Enix.
          The new additions to the controls have mostly become secondary actions that are activated in specific situations.<br>
          For instance, when normally jumping Lara to a ledge you press the [E] key to have her grab hold.
          There are now new situations where reaching the intended ledge is impossible by the normal action.
          It is too high for her to reach with only the tools you have memorized from the old game.<br>
          In game when you reach this new situation there is a small training section, usually between important story lines,
          that give you a chance to add the new command sequence to memory.
          In this instance Lara has found a spool of wire and attached it to her Ice axe, creating a grappling hook.
          This grappling hook is familiar to veteran players who have seen this in previous games from Eidos.
          In my case I immediately looked for the new signifier that would Visibly indicate where this item was to be used.
          From the old games it was a dangling loop of bronze, and in This Square Enix iteration it is a horizontal wrought iron railing hanging under a structure with a white painted line.
          Square Enix includes a white painted line as a visible signifier that an action is intended here.<br>
          This has somewhat lessened the difficulty in my opinion but keeps the player from becoming frustrated when they become turned around in a puzzle or lost in the game.
          The visibility and discoverability with the painted lines offers easily understood intention of progress.
          This is an intentional design by the developer to create ease of entry to new and veteran players alike.
