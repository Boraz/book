PLAN<br>
Frederik Lohner [5:31 PM] 
Admin:
Add restaurants
Add drivers
Link restaurants to drivers
Map of all<br>


Ahmed Almutawa [5:32 PM] 
Client:
Show available restaurants (driver view)
Show available drivers (restaurant view)<br>

We should have a client restaurant site let the restaurant to log in to see and add their customer order<br>
And once the client site add the order,it should be push to the firebase<br>
So on the restaurant site it should have a list of their order and a map view also<br>
The admin page should collect all the restaurant request and list it and also a list of current available provider and show both the restaurant and the provider on the map<br>
If we have some more time we can work on driver's client site and customer Order site<br>
But we at least should finish restaurant and admin site<br>
And we will run the provider simulator on the heroku<br>

How about two people do workers and admin and other two do the client<br>
I can do the admin page! since the restaurant page will be a little complicate,two people do for that<br>
Is that ok?<br>
